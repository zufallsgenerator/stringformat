pystringformat
==============

Current version: 0.3.x

This library provides Python-like string formatting for javascript.

Exports the function pystringformat to the global scope if run in a browser,
or the module pystringformat if run in node.js.

Example usage:

    var fmt = require("pystringformat");
    // if loaded bare-bone into a browser:
    //    var fmt = window.pystringformat;

    fmt("Hello, {}", "world");  // "Hello, world"
    fmt("{0:d} in decimal is {0:x} in hexadecimal. ", 32);  // "32 in decimal is 20 in hexadecimal. "
    fmt("There are only {0:b} types of people...", 2);  // "There are only 10 types of people..."
    fmt("Numbers can be padded {:6d}", 123); // "Numbers can be padded    123"
    fmt("{0} plus {0} equals {1}", "two", "four");  // "two plus two equals four"
    fmt("{:.4f}", 1.232));  // "1.2320";
    fmt("{:10.4f}", 1.232);  // "    1.2320"

    fmt("{a.x}", {a: {x: 2}});             // 2
    fmt("{a.b[1]}", {a: {b: [1, 2, 3]}})); // 2


Supports a subset of the String.format of python 2
See http://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html for documentation

Supported codes:
- s - string
- c - char from integer
- d - decimal
- o - octal
- x - hex
- X - uppercase hex
- b - binary
- e - exponential
- E - uppercase exponential
- f - fixed point
- F - same as f
- % - multiply by 100, and show with fixed 'f' format precision

If the argument after the format string is one Object it can be used as a dictionary.

## Known and deliberate differences from Python:
* Without width or format specifiers, all objects are coerced to string by default.
* Boolean can be formatted with 's' code, and is also by default.  In the Python implementation, it depends on the formatting string (not only the code)
* The 'f' code will at some point switch to exponential representation
* The 'n' code is left out, because the locale would have to be set explicitly
* The 'g' and 'G' codes are left out, since the semantics don't really make sense for javascript
* Bracket and dot notations are interchangeable (javascript only has one type of properties)

## Changelog

### Version 0.3.0

A small cleanup years later, April 2017.
Exporting function like a standard node module now, and window.pystringformat export only happens when loaded in a browser. Got rid of Bower and Grunt (kind of overkill for this) and replaced jasmine with mocha.

### Version 0.2.2

Fixed some cases where having arguments looking like format strings would mess up things.
Example:

    fmt("{}, {}!", "Hello, {}", "world"); // Should be "Hello, {}, world!"

Heavy refactoring.

### Version 0.2.1

No changes, updated the version number to see an update on npmjs.org

### Version 0.2
- A single object can be used as a dictionary
